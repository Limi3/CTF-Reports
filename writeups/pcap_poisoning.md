Step-by-Step
Hereâ€™s how I solved my first CTF:

Step 1: Open the PCAP file
When I first opened the PCAP file in Wireshark, I was scrolling through a lot of packets and didnâ€™t notice packet number 4 at all. After about 5 minutes, I finally took a closer look at it â€” and it caught my attention.

It showed something interesting: a username root and password toor. That definitely stood out, so I decided to follow the TCP stream.

Step 2: Follow the TCP Stream
When I followed the TCP stream, it revealed another packet â€” and this time the answer was literally in front of me. On the right side, it showed the flag in plain text: picoCTF...

This was my first time using Wireshark, so I wasn't sure what to do. I copied the encoded-looking text and pasted it into CyberChef to try decoding it. Turns out, I didnâ€™t need to â€” the flag was already visible in Wireshark the whole time ðŸ˜….

Lesson learned: always read carefully before overthinking it.
