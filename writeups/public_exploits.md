Hello this is how i solved the htb academy Penetration Tester/Getting Started/Public Exploits

Alright so the target was 94.237.61.242:32805
so first i went into firefox and put that target ip into the searchbar and we got this

and we can see that this is a wordpress site and we can see that the version is 2.7.10
so we use the metaslpoit framework and search any exploits with that wordpress version
and we configure the settings of the exploit so we can make it work

so we can see that we found an exploit but we didnt configure it yet 
lets configure it and start the exploit

ok great we set the RHOSTS to the target ip and the filepath to what we are looking for and also the port, now we run the exploit and boom we got the file
lets see what the file says
